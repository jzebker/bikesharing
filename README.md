# bikesharing
## Overview
Create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

</p>

  • Peak start times during the week appear to be in the morning ~7-9AM and early evening ~5-6PM; this corresponds with rush hour traffic in other places and it is possible these users are biking to and from work
  
  • On the weekend, user trips are more evenly spread throughout daylight hours, peaking at around midday
  
  • The least busy times are in the middle of the night

  • Users are primarily centered around the lower half of Manhattan
  
## Summary of NYC Data
Based on the above analysis, male subscribers make up the bulk of users.  Patterns of use are similar for both male and female users.  The majority of trips begin and end in the lower half Manhattan and are under 20 minutes in duration.  The busiest times of the week are during morning rush hour and afternoon rush hour.  Bike trips on the weekend are spread out more evenly.

## How Does this Apply to Des Moines
**Based on the data, people are using Citibike in New York.  Trips are concentrated where there are more people and these people appear to be using the bikes to go to and from work during the week.  If people in Des Moines like to bike to work, I see nothing from this data set that implies Des Moines residents will not use Citibike.**

## Suggestions for Further Development
The point of this analysis is to accompany a pitch to investors for Des Moines Citibike.  The population of Des Moines is just over 200k (per Google as of 2019, growth year to year is small) which is not comparable to NYC.  As a result, I feel it would be more prudent to look at data for Des Moines and not NYC.  I know nothing about Des Moines.

With that said other suggestions for the current dataset follow:

• Look at trip durations by start time of day (ex: How long are the trips for people checking out bikes during the peak times of the week?)

• Look at most frequently used bikes to try to predict maintenance needs

• Get more specific about WHERE the users are going to answer WHY they use Citibike (do certain types of commuters or certain companies use the service more? are people biking INSTEAD of driving or using the Subway? is NYC traffic important to Citibike? are users commuting? are they using bikes for exercise?)

• Collect information on users to sell it to somebody
